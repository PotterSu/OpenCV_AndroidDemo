OpenCV Demo for Android Platform
=================================

This project will teach you how to add OpenCV to your Android Project.

First, you should download OpenCV (Andorid SDK) from https://opencv.org/releases/ 

Next, you should `replace the OpenCV path in /arm_bin_OpenCV/Android.mk to your own OpenCV SDK Path`. 

Finally, you can run the Demo! 

Open your terminal and enter: 

cd /your/path/to/arm_bin_OpenCV 

sh build.sh 

sh run.sh 

just ok!
